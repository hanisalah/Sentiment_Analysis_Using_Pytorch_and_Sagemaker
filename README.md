# Sentiment Analysis using Pytorch and AWS SageMaker Deployment Project

This is a Sentiment Analysis project used to predict positive / negative movie reviews.

The model is built using pytorch.

The model is deployed using AWS SageMaker.

The code is here to share, however I have already deleted the endpoint from SageMaker for billing purposes :)

Please see the [README](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment/tree/master/README.md) in the root directory for instructions on setting up a SageMaker notebook and downloading the project files (as well as the other notebooks).
